# vblog 2.0

This is the ancient blog engine I wrote myself and actually used to power the [blog](blog.valerauko.net/) from about 2006 to 2014 when it just wouldn't work anymore and I switched to using WP.

It's the source code as I found it in an old backup file. I don't have version history (hell I didn't even know git was a thing).

The code is probably not safe or a good reference for anything. Especially considering it was written over 15 years ago with only vague ideas about what "good code" should be and no reviews. If you can find any place that'd let you run these ancient versions of PHP and MySQL, you might be able to get it to run, but it's got so much very personal stuff (like the layout) hard-coded that I don't think it's worth.

I'm only sharing this as a record to history. Also so people can laugh and point at how bad it is (may be). I'm positive passwords to database and such are hardcoded somewhere too, but none of those servers exist anymore so who cares. There's even some Flash in there if you look careful enough!

Media like uploads and the avatars I used are not included.
